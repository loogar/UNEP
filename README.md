Welcome to the UNEP-GEF enlighten initiative Prototype Lighting Product Registration System. 

As part of the UNEP en.lighten initiative Southeast Asia and the Pacific Monitoring, Verification and Enforcement (MVE) Project, the UNEP-GEF en.lighten initiative has developed a prototype registration system to illustrate the capabilities and highlight the benefits of product registration systems. The prototype enables those who wish to implement a fully operational system to do so more quickly and easily because they have a model on which to base their system.

Policymakers may review the prototype and consider whether to use it (in whole or part) as a basis for their product registration systems. The prototype registration system is informed by global best practices and contains the essential elements of a registration system, including user input forms, data tables, and output reports. The registration system has separate login credentials for applicants, regulators and administrators to ensure smooth processing of applications.
